Since I first heard about Soylent in Rob Rhinehart now famous article ["How I stopped eating food"](http://robrhinehart.com/?p=298), it became the subject of some of the most heated debates I had in a long time.

There is no wonder why Soylent became so polemical. ·Claiming to revolutionize an industry that developed itself over millenia, encapsulating some key steps of human evolution like farming and rearing is a bold statement. Then again, human communication did itself undergo a drastic change during the course of last centuries, although this change was factored by a lot of smaller advancements (from printing all the way up to wireless internet).

One thing that impressed me was the precision put into Soylent recipe summed up in Rob's ["What's in Soylent"](http://robrhinehart.com/?p=424) article.
But what appalled me more was the fact that this is not new information, as modern medicine now has a deep understanding of biochemical exchanges and interactions taking place in the human body.
So what was holding us from using that knowledge to optimize our food consumption and provide our bodies with a diet close to what would be its ideal fuel?

Rob again gives us some keys in ["In Defense of New Food"](http://robrhinehart.com/?p=507), responding both to concerns and criticism on the matter.
People like to stick to their habits, are concern with the novelty and tend to satisfy themselves with the current state of affairs.
This is the kind of backward thinking that kept ["bloodletting"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodletting) as a method to cure illness for almost 2000 years.

One of the most recent read on the subject is ["The Drab Stupidity of Soylent"](http://www.kernelmag.com/comment/column/4264/the-drab-stupidity-of-soylent/) article written by Greg Stevens.
Greg have some harsh words, but the main criticisms could be summed up is those two citations:

>A mix that is optimized for a 20-something inactive underweight male could quite easily kill a 60-year-old woman or a 30-year-old athlete

This is one of the main concerns anybody can have. Even if I do think it's a little exaggerated to say that your mix could kill grandma if you switch plates, this is a valid point. In fact this is a point addressed on one of the first lines of [Soylent's website](https://campaign.soylent.me/soylent-free-your-body) :  *"Soylent will be personalized for different body types and customizable based on individual goals"*.

>Rhinehart might not realise it, but he is a classic symptom of a generation [...] that appears to believe you don’t actually need to know facts: all you need to do is be creative and enthusiastic.

This second one is based on the fact that Rhinehart is not and probably never will be a nutritionist. He is an engineer, working and thinking inside that ideological bubble floating above the Silicon Valley. It's not the patronizing tone that felt the worst in that sentence; it's the subsequent labelling put on Rob and eventually anyone. You are an engineer, stick to your code. You are a accountant, no way you can bring anything to poetry.

Of course you can't revolutionize any field without having a minimal knowledge of its in and outs. But sometimes, all it takes is some ingenuity and passion to acquire that very specific subset of skills you will need to achieve greatness.

After all, it's what it took for the [Wright Brothers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers) to become infinitely more than bike sellers.
