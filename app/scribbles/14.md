##Thrive on competition
If there are a lot of competitors, it means there is an active market. And when there is a market, it's always possible to tap into it by bringing something new and - ideally - unexpected.

##Don't assume people needs
Would you download and use your own app ? If the answer is no, you may have a problem. Ask other people their opinion, but don't get too hyped if the response is overly positive; we all hate to crush someone's dream.

##Choose design over functionality
By focusing on design, an app can be made simpler to use and more attractive to the user. Keep in mind that **most users prefer a nice polished blade to an ugly Swiss army knife**.

##Tease at the right time
Offer a quick peek to some - preferably influential - targeted users just before release. This can spark waves of interest via social networks. Don't do it too early though, as trends quickly fade away.

##Target with surgical precision
Communicating to ten individuals from your target group will often carry more result than communicating to a thousand random ones. 

##Understand monetization psychology
Users will give money based on how much they value an app, not on how much it cost to develop. That's why [the most expensive apps are in the medical category](http://blog.sensortower.com/blog/2013/08/27/a-detailed-look-at-top-performing-ios-app-pricing-by-category/). In some cases, it may even hurt the perceived quality if your app is too cheap.

##Allow easy feedback
Users tend to give feedback via the App Store review system. Everyone is frustrated from this one-way exchange. If you want to keep high ratings and quality reviews, you may want to give them an easy way to contact your staff from within the app. An email link usually does the trick.

*Example on iOS*
```objective-c
NSString *url = @"mailto:support@awesomeapp.com?&subject=Feedback";
[[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL: [NSURL URLWithString: url]];
```
