##The 7 Minute Workout program

After reading several articles about the revolutionary "7 minute workout", I decided to implement an iOS application to be the perfect training assistant for this program.

First, some background. The "7 minute workout" is inspired by the HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) which purpose is to get maximum results in the shortest timespan.
According to a [recent study](http://goo.gl/CA6PK), only two weeks of HIIT training could increase aerobic capacity as much as six to eight weeks of usual training.
It was even featured on the [New York Times](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout) and in [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/this-7-minute-research-based-workout-exercises-your-wh-498676327).

Anyway, if you have to remember something about the studies that have been made, it's this (HICT being a synonym of HIIT):
>HICT may be an extremely effective and efficient means by which to increase an individual’s V˙O2max, a well-established marker of cardiopulmonary health. When HICT protocols have been compared with traditional steady state protocols in the laboratory, HICT elicits similar and sometimes greater gains in V˙O2max, despite significantly lower exercise volume


##Building the app

It took me a long weekend to build the application from scratch, with about 2/3 of it being proper coding time. My process was first to sketch what I wanted to implement then directly dive into the code. I am no designer and using Photoshop is kind of a pain, especially on my Macbook 13', so I decided to go with something light using the awesome [flat-ui-kit library](https://github.com/Grouper/FlatUIKit) provided by [Grouper](https://www.joingrouper.com/).

In terms of UX, I was clearly inspired by the [7-min](http://7-min.com) website which really focus on the essential. The sound was also a feature I felt crucial for the user to follow the program without having to always keep an eye on his iPhone.

I decided mid development to add a feature allowing the user to customize its program, as I don't think everybody will be able to chain those 12 exercises from the beginning. We'll call it the mid-dev crisis. It was also a choice I made to broaden the audience and the usability of the app itself, so in the end I believe it was a good decision.
That addition gave me the possibility to insert an in-app purchase feature (more an in-app donation feature I would say, as none of the functionalities are blocked), something I had never done before.

Next I had to localize every texts of the application (english and french for now) which as expected was an ultra boring part. I then moved on to create the splashscreens for the application and the infamous icon (for which I could reserve its own scribble, that's for sure). After a few hours of tweaking on Photoshop and surfing [dribbble](http://www.dribbble.com), I finally managed to create an icon I was somewhat proud about.

The final part was of course the submission to Apple, which for the non-initiated is the perfect way to throw thyself from the nearest bridge (especially if you come from the Android world). Fortunately I had already experienced this during my daytime work and am quite use to it by now.
There was a small mishap with the in-app functionnality which cause Apple to reject the app twice. The first time because I had forgotten to check if the user had already purchased the in-app and to restore the app state accordingly. Classic.
The second one was a little sneakier, I did not add the "StoreKit" framework to my main project, as it was already embedded via the libraries I use. Nevertheless it must have raised a flag on the review tool Apple is using.
Anyway both of those issue were quickly resolved on my end, but it delayed the app release for two weeks, which was quite frustrating.

##The result

This was a really fun project to work on and I hope it will motivate people exercizing more and help them get in shape quickly and efficiently !
Without further ado, here are some screenshots of the application that you can find [on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/7-minutes-workout/id650627810?l=en&ls=1&mt=8).
