A little over 2 months ago was released **7 Minutes Workout**. This app was the result of a long weekend project inspired by the "7-Minute Workout" program that was buzzing at the time, mostly because of [this New York Times article](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout).

That wasn't exactly enough for me to kickstart the project. But later I saw the [7-min.com](http://7-min.com) website making the first page of Hacker News, and I realized this would be really great as an App.

##What went right
###From zero to hero
Immediatly after the app publication, a fair amount of download was being generated, **between 150 and 300 a day on average**. It stayed that way for 2 weeks then dropped to 100/day, decreasing slowly.
It could have kept this curve, but 6 weeks after release, bam :

**The app became #1 on the App Store and the downloads went through the roof**. How? For almost a week, I had no ideas, but I knew there had to be an external cause. And indeed it was, as I learnt after being contacted by a French company which had had a "coup de coeur" for **7 Minutes Workout**. They subsequently decided to feature it in one of their own apps.

This gave me an interesting look at how exponentially promotion works. If your app get downloaded a lot during a short timespan, you hit a critical point where **your popularity generates more popularity and gets you sky high in a matter of hours**.

This newly gained fame generated much more than just downloads, as I've been since then contacted by multiples companies, including some very known ones, offering ways to leverage some of that popularity.

An interesting leverage was App4Free, a company which aim to provide mutual visibility by featuring your application as long as you offer it (or any in-app funcionality) for free. It felt like a good opportunity and I took it, but the results were less impressive this time. I learned a valuable lesson though : **a small set of people from your target group will bring you more than a large set outside of it**.

###Money Money Money
Generating money from an App is not easy, and I started with a quite naive monetization plan : giving the app for free and put a "donation" button inside it. I thought people using it often would tend to donate. Not really. **I found that one country was far ahead in terms of transformation rate though : USA**. But it was still pretty low.

After getting a huge number of users, I decided to change my monetization plan to something more common. Instead of asking for a donation, I decided to block one of the features used by power users and see how it goes. **Not surprisingly, purchases were multiplied by 3 to 5**.

##What went wrong
Obviously this project wasn't a disaster, but there are still some mishap that could have been avoided.

First, when I released the app I did so declaring it compatible with every devices from iOS5 and up. I realized soon after that I was using iOS6 only functions in my code that caused the app to crash on iOS5. I took my sweet time to correct it. Big mistake there.

*Here is the bad boy*

``` objective-c
    [_pageControl setPageIndicatorTintColor:[UIColor peterRiverColor]];
    [_pageControl setCurrentPageIndicatorTintColor:[UIColor cloudsColor]];
```

When the surge of downloads happened, an approximate 8% of users experimented the crash and I witnessed firsthand that **unhappy users are far more likely to drop a review than happy ones**. It sunk my rating for a whole week while I was praying to St Steve for a quick processing of my submitted update.

Second and it probably seems obvious, I should have gone with a better monetization plan from the start. Moreover, blocking a feature between 2 versions made some disgruntled users - even if it was not as much as I expected.

##Wrap up
**I'm not over with this project yet**, there are still features to add and partners to make, but this felt like a good time to step back and take a mental picture of this point in time where the fog of ideas and most of the excitement has lift off.

For those interested, here are the download statistics pulled from Flurry Analytics.
