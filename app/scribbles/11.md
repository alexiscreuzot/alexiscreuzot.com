Reusability is key to optimise software development on any platform. Although a reccuring issue come from the fact that every software project is different.
It means there is some thinking to do before running head on. How long would it take to just do a custom one each time?  How low level a component must be to be reusable in most cases? Libraries usually choose to stick pretty close to the system by enhancing existing functions, introducing default behaviors and even sometimes code conventions(see most Active Record libraries for instance).

On my last component dedicated to iOS application settings, I decided to go all the way up to the UI. The main reason for that choice is the fact that settings screens usually don't change that much between apps, but are non-the-less a critically time consuming task.

##Prerequisite

A settings component need to be able to display localized data to the user with different degrees of interactions. This data must be persisted throughout the app lifecycle but also to be modified by the developer in future versions.
Here how I chosed to tackle some of those issues.

###Persistence
To persist settings data I chose to create a specific modelisation. A `Group` model, containning one or more `Item` models. This kind of modelisation is based on the fact that the user usually some context to understand the data displayed (Units format, Language, Links, etc...), hence the utility of a  `Group`. It's also very convenient for the display as we will see later.
Those model are then mapped from a JSON file to be inserted in a SQLite database. Here's how an `Item` looks, using `iActiveRecord` to persist it transparently.

####JSON

```json
{
"order": 1,
"groupKey": "time_format",
"items": [{
          "order": 1,
          "itemKey": "time_format_24",
          "itemControlType": "select",
          "itemValue": "YES"
          },
          {
          "order": 2,
          "itemKey": "time_format_12",
          "itemControlType": "select",
          "itemValue": "NO"
          }]
}
```

####Objective-C

```objective-c
@interface SettingsItem : ActiveRecord

belongs_to_dec(SettingsGroup, group, ARDependencyNullify)

@property (strong,nonatomic) NSNumber * settingsGroupId;
@property (strong,nonatomic) NSNumber * order;
@property (strong,nonatomic) NSString * itemKey;
@property (strong,nonatomic) NSString * itemControlType;
@property (strong,nonatomic) NSString * itemValue;

// ...

@end
```

An item is displayed in a specific group, at a specific order, and is defined by an `ItemKey`. Its `itemControlType` is here to display the `itemValue` in a certain way (text, switch, link...).

###Migration
Now, we have some data persisted in the database, but what if we need to change some of the settings? Adding new groups and/or items is not too complicated, but we want to be able to modify and delete potentially obsolete items.

We need a static method to check at each start how the JSON file evolved to update the database with any created, modified or deleted items.

```objective-c
@interface SettingsItem : ActiveRecord

//...

+ (void) updateFromArray:(NSArray *) array;

@end
```

###Display & Interaction
Having `Groups` and `Items` is the perfect way to populate an UITableView, `Groups` being sections and `Items` being cells.
As explained earlier, each `Item` have an `itemControlType`. A simple `if-else` clause in our controller can now handle the display consequently.
It's also a good thing to not have hard-coded colors, but use variables in order to easily style the settings panel from inside our outside its UIViewController.

```Objective-C
- (void) styleCell:(UITableViewCell *) cell ForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{
    SettingsItem * row = groupsOfItems[indexPath.section][indexPath.row];

    if([@"switch" isEqualToString:row.itemControlType]){
        // Style for switch
    }else if([@"select" isEqualToString:row.itemControlType]){
        // Style for select
    }else if([@"link" isEqualToString:row.itemControlType]){
        // Style for link
    }else if([@"info" isEqualToString:row.itemControlType]){
        // Style for info
    }
    //...
}
```

Now for the interaction, the selects and links can be easily handled in the `tableView:didSelectRowAtIndexPath:` method, based on their control type, then on their key if needed.

```Objective-C
- (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{
    SettingsGroup * group = settingsGroups[indexPath.section];
    SettingsItem * row = groupsOfItems[indexPath.section][indexPath.row];

    // Selects
    if([@"select" isEqualToString:row.itemControlType]){
        [Settings setSelectGroup:group.groupKey SelectedForKey:row.itemKey];
    }

    // Links
    if([@"link" isEqualToString:row.itemControlType]){

        if([@"links_rate" isEqualToString:row.itemKey]){
            [SVProgressHUD showSuccessWithStatus:@"rate"];
        }else if([@"links_share" isEqualToString:row.itemKey]){
            [SVProgressHUD showSuccessWithStatus:@"share"];
        }
    }
}
```
For the other controls, we just need to implement the required delegates to handle the interactions.

###Localization
Last but not least, we want all that data to be localized. Once all the previous work has been done, it's pretty straightforward, as we just have to reuse the `ItemKey` in our localized files and put this little line in our `tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:` method :

```Objective-C
cell.textLabel.text = NSLocalizedString([currentRow.itemKey uppercaseString], nil);
```

##Result

###JSON

```json

  {
  "order": 10,
  "groupKey": "display",

            "order": 1,

            "itemSubtitle": "other_copyrights_sub",
            "itemControlType": "info"
            }]
  }
  ]
```

From now on, any Settings screen should not take more than half a day to integrate & test. That's more time to do the fun stuff !
