Cocoapods is one of the main tools developers rely on when building an app for iOS or OSX. There is no official support for Swift projects, but you can still use it using the following method.

First, create your Podfile and add the pods you need as usual.

![podfile](https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*ZJgYyIQFmFcAmH1SRwOxZg.png)

Install them using the pod install command and open the .xcworkspace file created in your project folder. Pods should now be included in your workspace.

Now for the interesting part. In order to use those pods, you are going to create a bridging header file. Click on File -> New -> File… and select “Header File” in the “Source” tab.

![bridging_header](https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/708/1*_2YVqX3WjNF-iGnVr7uE5w.png)

Name this file project_name-Bridging-Header.h.

Open your project Build Settings and search for “Bridging”. Edit the key “Objective-C Bridging Header” to project_name/project_name-Bridging-Header.h.

Here my project is named “SwiftBasics”
You are now ready to add your imports into your Bridging-Header.h file for the pods you want to use, just as you would do in your .pch file.

That’s it, you can now use your pods*. You don’t even have to import them again in your .swift files. You can also import any other Objective-C file added to your workspace this way. Sweet !

I hope you liked this article, I’ll post more tips for Swift as I dive deeper into Swift.

*Warning, some specific pods may not work or need additional configuration.
